Opposite the two avatars on the far wall of the 3D space, you will see a total of four dots.  You will also see some visual barriers perpendicular to the back wall.	2	Please press space bar to see an example of this 3D space.	2	blankav.png	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the next few slides, we will present you with just one avatar within the 3D environment. All you need to do is indicate how many dots that avatar can see by pressing the 1 or 2 key on your keyboard.	4	Please press space bar to continue.	4	blankav.png	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
