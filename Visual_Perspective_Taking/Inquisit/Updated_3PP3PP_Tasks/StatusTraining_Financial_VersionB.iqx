Welcome to the Perspective-Taking Task
^^We are interested in studying how people think of others based on what can be learned from short stories. 
^^You will shortly read some stories about two individuals with different jobs, education levels, and living situations. 
^^These individuals will be represented by virtual avatars.  You will later have the chance to take the visual perspectives of these avatars.
^^These avatars will be dressed in different colors.
^^We would now like you to get to know these avatars.
</page>

<page instruction.M>
In the following screens, you will see each of the two avatars used in this study from a number of possible angles (e.g., viewed from the front, from the side, or from above).  Each avatar will appear along with a short story describing his background.
^^One avatar represents James and another represents Eric.  
^^PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!  We will be testing your memory for information about these individuals at multiple points in this study.  Incorrect answers to these memory tests may lead to rejection of a completed HIT.  The stories are short, so you will have no problem remembering everything if you take your time in reading them.
</page>

In the following screens, you will see each of the two avatars used in this study from a number of possible angles (e.g., viewed from the front, from the side, or from above).  Each avatar will appear along with a short story describing her background.
^^One avatar represents Jenny and another represents Erica.  Both individuals live in the same city, known for its large shopping mall, Mall One.  Every year, Mall One attracts visitors from around the country.  Although Jenny and Erica grew up in the same city and work at the same shopping mall, they are not personally acquainted.
^^PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!  We will be testing your memory for information about these individuals at multiple points in this study.

Great work! We will test your memory for the association between identity and color shortly.
^^You will be presented with avatars and their names, but this time without any further information. You will be asked to indicate the avatar's job by pressing 1 or 2.
^^For example, you will see a question similar to the one below: 
^^This person works as the Auto Dealership Director.  What is this person's name?
^Press 1 for Eric          Press 2 for James
^^If you make errors, you will have to press the correct key in order to advance.
^^If you are ready, you may start now.
